# Usage

To use the sorting visualizer, simply go to the deployed project URL. The app will automatically load and show you a visualization of the default sorting algorithm (merge sort). You can choose to visualize any of the following sorting algorithms:

- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort

To visualize a different sorting algorithm, simply select it from the drop-down menu and click the "Generate New Array" button. The app will generate a new array of random numbers and show you a visualization of the selected sorting algorithm sorting the array.

# Development

To run the sorting visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sorting-visualizer.git
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Start the development server: npm start
4. The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000/. You can make changes to the code and see them reflected in the app.
